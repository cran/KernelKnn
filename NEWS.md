## KernelKnn 1.0.4

I added a try-catch Rcpp function to make possible the calculation of singular covariance matrices as sugggested in https://github.com/mlampros/KernelKnn/issues/1


## KernelKnn 1.0.3

Reimplementation of the Rcpp function due to ASAN-memory-errors


## KernelKnn 1.0.2

I updated the Description file with a URL and a BugReports web-address.


## KernelKnn 1.0.1

Currently, Software platforms like OSX do not support openMP, thus I've made openMP optional for all cpp functions.


## KernelKnn 1.0.0
